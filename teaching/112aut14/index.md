    1. What are the square numbers in one's digit arithmetic?
    1. Which of the above numbers have two different square-roots?

    +   TEN
    -------
    = SIXTY
    </pre>
1. (Tutorial) Consider the set $\{e, a, b\}$. Come up with an abelian group structure on this set such that $e$ is the identity element, and write out the addition table. Is there more than one possible structure? How about on the set $\{e, a, b, c\}$?

1. (Tutorial) Exercise 2.3

#### HW 4
In this homework, you will read some "light" articles related to mathematics. The readings are up on the Chalk page under Assignments folder. Each reading assignment has an associated short writing assignment, also up on Chalk.

#### Midterm 1 Review
1. Review the triangle game, especially all practice problems. Review the cross game from the homework. What are the symmetries in each case? What is the reasoning for coming up with the solutions?
1. Read and remember all the axioms of addition, multiplication, and ordering.
1. What is the additive inverse of $1$ in $\mathbb{Z}$? In even-odd arithmetic? In one's digit arithmetic?
1. What is the multiplicative inverse of $1$ in each of the above systems? (Does it always exist?) Which elements have multiplicative inverses in each of the above systems?
1. Review the proofs of the theorems from the book, such as $0\cdot a = 0$, etc. What axioms do we use in each case?
1. Think about whether it is possible to give an order on the set $\{0, 1\}$, such that the four axioms O1, O2, O3, O4 hold for even/odd arithmetic. If yes, what are the possiblities? If not, why not?

#### HW 7.5
This homework is due by email, and it is due by 5pm on Friday, Nov 21. This homework will be graded for completion, not for content.

1. Email me your project drafts _as they are in their current state_. One person from each team should send the email and cc your teammates (though of course you should have worked on the drafts collectively). Don't worry much about errors, gaps, or formatting.
1. Send me the following information individually in a short email (don't cc your teammates):
    * What has your individual contribution been to the project write-up so far?
    * What more do you individually plan to put in the project write-up?

#### HW 8
1. Exercise 5.17
1. Exercise 5.18
1. Exercise 5.29 (Hint: Multiply both sides of the equation by $n$.)
1. Exercise 6.1

1. Exercise 6.16
1. (Tutorial) Exercise 6.17
1. (Tutorial) Exercise 5.22

#### Final Exam Review
1. The syllabus for the midterm consists of everything that we have done since the beginning of the course. The new material consists of chapter 5 and parts of chapter 6 and 7: most of section 6.1 (congruences, addition and multiplication under congruences, and what axioms they satisfy), and section 7.1 (divisibility tests).
1. (Important) Go over all old homeworks and review guidelines for Midterms 1 and 2. 
1. Review how to compute $\sigma(n)$.
1. Review the definition of perfect numbers, and of Mersenne numbers.
1. Review the proof of theorem 5.7.
1. Review LCM and the formula $a\times b = \text{gcd}(a,b)\times \text{lcm}(a,b)$.
1. Review how to compute the Egyptian fraction decomposition.
1. Go over the definition of congruence modulo some number, and of a residue class or congruence class (on page 131).
1. Review how to add, subtract, and multiply congruence classes (Theorem 6.3 , 6.4).
1. Review all the divisibility tests we learned in class. You may be asked some indirect problems from this section, so make sure you understand how the tests work, especially the combined test for 7, 11, and 13.
