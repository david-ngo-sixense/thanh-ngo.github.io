### Winter 2015
In Winter 2015, we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3pm in the Barn (Ry 352). On Thursdays, we are reading through the notes _Homogeneous Spaces and Equivariant Embeddings_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602228)) by D. A Timashev. On Tuesdays, we discuss the class _Geometric Satake and Hecke Algebras_, which is being taught by Victor Ginzburg.

### Autumn 2014
The organizers for the seminar are now Ana Balibanu and Sergei Sagatov. We met on Thursdays at 3pm in the Barn (Ry 352). The topic was Character Sheaves.

We loosely followed these references:

* Williamson's notes on a course by Ostrik ([pdf](http://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/geordie/Ostrik.pdf)),
* McGerty's notes ([pdf](https://documents.epfl.ch/users/j/jt/jtaylor/www/charsheaves/PDF/mcgerty.pdf)), and
* _Character Sheaves_ by Mars and Springer, Ast√©risque 173-174 (1989).

The talks were given by Jonathan Wang.

### Spring 2014
In the Spring 2014 quarter, we meet on Mondays and Fridays at 1:30pm in Eck 207. We are (vaguely) reading from the book _A Guide to Quantum Groups_ by V. Chari and A. Pressley. The talk schedule is as follows.
