<p>
The Pl&uuml;cker embedding describes the Grassmannian as a closed
subvariety of projective space. I will explain (in very simple terms)
how to go from linearly independent vectors $v_1, \dotsc, v_k$ in
$n$-space to the point in projective space representing the vector space
$\text{Span}(v_1, \dotsc, v_k) \in G(k,n)$. (This will take about two
minutes.) I will then proceed to more confusing issues: Why does this
map depend only on the span of the $v_i$? Why is it injective on the
Grassmannian? Why is the its image a closed subvariety of projective
space?  The answers will involve factorization in the exterior algebra
(considered as a ring).
</p>
<p>
If I have time, I address a somewhat less basic question: What do
lines contained in the Grassmannian look like? (They turn out to be
the Schubert varieties of dimension $1$, but you won't need to know what
that means to understand my description.)
</p>

<p>
This talk will be at a basic level, perhaps more so than the relevant
passage in Joe Harris's book "First Course" (which, to be honest, I
find a little confusing on this particular topic). The primary tool
used will be exterior algebra.

<h4>Daniele Rosso</h4>
<p>
Flag varieties are interesting spaces that come up all the time
in representation theory (among other places).
I will give some definitions and talk about the Bruhat decomposition and
Schubert cells, hopefully with some examples.
Depending on how much time this will take, I might or might not mention the
RSK correspondence (which appears very surprisingly in the geometry of some
subvarieties of the flag variety).

<h4>Charles Staats</h4>
<p>
The intersection theory for projective space is so
simple as to be almost boring, at least in its statement: the
intersection ring is generated, as a ring, by the class $[H]$ of
a hyperplane. The class $[H]^k$ is represented by the
intersection of $k$ general hyperplanes. The only relation is
that when you intersect too many hyperplanes, you get zero.
</p>
<p>
Like projective space, Grassmannians have an intersection ring
that is well understood, with a standard basis represented by
geometrically motivated subvarieties, in this case called
Schubert varieties. Unlike in the case of projective space,
the intersection ring of Grassmannians is complex enough to
give non-obvious geometric information about these
subvarieties.  In my first talk, I will work out one or more
examples of intersection rings for Grassmannians.  I will
avoid being very technical; most of the computations will be
"by picture." I should get to at least one result that is not
obvious, at least to me:
</p>
<p>
Q: If you have four lines in general position in $\mathbb{P}^3$, describe
the set of lines intersecting all four of them.<br/>
A: There are exactly two such lines.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, I will hopefully be a little bit more systematic,
if not rigorous, in describing the intersection rings for
Grassmannians.

<h4>Dan Le</h4>
<p>
In a first class on representation theory, one
learns about a very strange looking functor called induction
and an equally strange looking theorem called Frobenius
reciprocity. These are in fact essential tools for
representation theory. I'll recall these things, then discuss
Fourier (or harmonic) analysis, the Peter-Weyl theorem, the
hydrogen atom, and the Borel-Weil theorem with some nice
examples from algebraic geometry. Warning: there may be a
mention of number theory.

<h4>Simion Filip: Belyi's theorem</h4>
<p>
Suppose $X$ is an algebraic curve defined over a number field. Belyi's theorem says that it admits a map to $\mathbb{P}^1$, ramified only over $0$,$1$ and $\infty$. I'll explain a proof of this, why the converse is "trivial", and hopefully why this is at all interesting.
</p>

<div class="talk">
<h4>Daniel Le</h4>
<p>
$e^{\pi \sqrt{163}}$ is an integer&hellip; almost. I'll
explain why this number is so so close to an integer. On the
way, I'll discuss (explicit) reciprocity laws, complex
multiplication, and Galois representations.
</p>

<h4>27 Jun 2012</h4>
<p>Noon, Eck 312</p>

<div class="talk">
<h4>Preston Wake</h4>
<p>
In number theory, some of the oldest questions are about Diophantine
equations: given a set of algebraic equations with integer
coefficients, how many solutions are there in the integers? These
questions are very difficult in general, but a necessary condition is
that the solution modulo a prime $p$ should give a solution to the
equations modulo $p$. So a simpler question is: given a set of
equations over a finite field, how many solutions are there in the
finite field? Do I get more solutions if I allow my solutions to live
in a field extension? How many more?
</p>
<p>
To answer these questions, we can form the zeta function associated to
the problem, which is a kind of generating function for the sequence
$a_n=\#\{\text{solutions in }\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\}$. When the set of equations cut out a
smooth proper algebraic variety, Andre Weil made some very deep
conjectures about this zeta function, and proved his conjectures in
some simple cases.  Grothendieck and his school proved all but one of
these conjectures using ideas from algebraic topology. I will explain
their basic argument. Deligne then provided a proof of the remaining
conjecture, the Riemann Hypothesis, in a way which shockingly (<a
href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/14849/what-would-a-moral-proof-of-the-weil-conjectures-require">and
immorally?</a>) used analysis. I will explain the basic idea of his
proof in the case of an elliptic curve&mdash;there will be pictures.

</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Asilata Bapat</h4>
<p>
The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are certain structure constants
that appear in the representation theory of the symmetric group, as
well in several other problems. In this talk, I will present some of
the mathematics surrounding these numbers, and links between the
different questions they answer. Among other things, I will talk about
representations of $GL_n$ and Schur polynomials.

<h4>13 Jun 2012</h4>
<p>Noon, Eck 312</p>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Daniel Le</h4>
<p>
The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the $\mathbb{Q}$-points of an elliptic
curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ form a finitely generated abelian group. A theorem of
Mazur classifies the possible torsion parts of these groups. In this talk,
I'll explain why an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ has no 11-torsion
defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.
