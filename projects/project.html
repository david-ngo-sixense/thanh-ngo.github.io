	<h3 id="Context">Context:</h3> 
	<p>One of the main issues raised by nuclear fusion relates to the safe exploitation of wall materials that can withstand high heat flux. To satisfy these requirements, numerous
diagnostics are implemented, especially Infrared (IR) and visible camera to survey and study the behavior of the wall. A powerful Imaging Software is therefore essential in order to analyze
the data. In this context, since 2016, within the <a href="http://irfm.cea.fr/">IRFM (Institute for Magnetic Fusion Research)</a>, <a href="">CEA Cadarache</a>,  I am in charge of the conception and development of a software platform for the exploitation of imaging diagnostics in
 nuclear fusion devices (WEST tokamak of the CEA/Cadarache and Wendelstein 7-X stellarator of IPP Greifswald).
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="Imaging_Software">Imaging software:</h3>
	<p>
	The software is a C++ framework with Qt library which is aimed to provide a visualization and analysis tool for infra-red data.  Some of its functionalites :
	<ul>
		<li>It allows users to read and display IR videos (and other diagnostic data) from WEST database</li>
		<li>It defines some image processing algorithms: rotation, mirror, component labelling, thresholding, watershed segmentation, k-means clustering, extraction of bounding box</li>
		<li>A thermal event detection editor plugin for annotating and evaluating thermal event detection, tracking and recognition. This plugin allows users (physicist) to manually detect /annotate thermal events
		  and correct event detection results (remove false alarm and./or add  miss-detection object). Users then upload the detected thermal events into the SQL database.		   The goal is to generate ground truth data for evaluating the automatic detection algorithm and feeding the learning network . </li>
		<li>A SQL thermal event database plugin  allows users to connect to the thermal event database, perform data mining based on some pre-defined criteria (discharge number, camera target, region of interest, type of thermal event) or  by submitting a SQL query.  User can replay thermal events into related IR videos.</li>

	We develop a method  to detect, track thermal events using feature extraction (motion and visual patterns) from offline videos. By using the thermal event detection editor plugin, experts  annotate thermal events and correct event detection results (remove false alarm and/or
	 add miss-detection object) and saved them into the SQL Database. They create a ground truth to feed the neural network. 	 A CNN (convolutional neural network) is trained with event features. The network is then used to detect and track   thermal events in a new IR video.

	<b>Abstract:</b> an automated detection of rectangular buildings from monocular very high resolution aerial images,
	 based on a novel region-growing image segmentation algorithm is proposed. 
	 The input image is first decomposed into a set of homogeneous primitive regions.
	  Regions are then grouped into different clusters by a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based region classification. 
	  According to the position of the shadows, a merging procedure is performed over regions that belongs to the same cluster to produce regions whose shapes are appropriate to rectangles. This iterative classification-merging stops when no merging happens. 
	  Final building regions are extracted from the obtained region growing image segmentation result.
	   The experimental results prove that the proposed method is applicable in various areas (high dense urban, suburban, and rural) and is highly robust and reliable.

<b>Abstract:</b> A new method for simultaneously detecting shadows and vegetation in remote sensing images, based on Otsu’s thresholding method and Dempster-Shafer (DS) fusion which aims at combining different shadow indices and vegetation indices in order to increase the information quality and to obtain a more reliable and accurate segmentation result. The DS fusion is carried out pixel by pixel and is incorporated
 in the Markovian context while obtaining the optimal segmentation with the energy minimization scheme associated with the Markov random field (MRF). This new approach is applied on remote sensing images and demonstrates its efficiency.

<p> 
<b>Abstract:</b>  European sea bass is a highly mobile species whose spatial dynamics remain poorly understood. In order to analyze adult migration patterns, we carried out tagging experiments (acoustic telemetry and data storage tags) off the coast of west Brittany. Acoustic tracking provided 3D behaviour used to parameterize a geolocation method from DST data (depth and temperature). To date, 21 DSTs out of 246 have been recovered. Our geolocation model (daily predicted probability maps issued from a HMM - hidden Markov model) combines both satellite SST data and the hydrodynamic model MARS3D. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates its robustness to recover consistent movement patterns. Fish with long times at liberty exhibited strong site fidelity to summer feeding ground. Reconstructed individual trajectories revealed different spawning migration patterns (mostly in the Bay of Biscay but also in the Celtic sea/English Channel). The joint analysis of horizontal and vertical movements showed seasonal behavioural shifts. Our results support the hypothesis of a fine scale spatial structuring at the population scale, 
a key issue poorly addressed by current management frameworks. It also provides key information for the understanding and the modelling of the spatial dynamics of the species under environmental forcing.
